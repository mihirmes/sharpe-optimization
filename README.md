# Sharpe Ratio Optimization Dashboard

https://sharpe-optimization.streamlit.app/

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit-based dashboard designed to optimize and visualize portfolios using the Sharpe Ratio. The dashboard allows users to select predefined sets of tickers or enter custom tickers to simulate and optimize portfolios based on historical market data. The optimization process identifies the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, providing the best risk-adjusted return.

## Features

- **Portfolio Optimization**: Simulate and optimize portfolios with thousands of iterations to find the one with the highest Sharpe Ratio.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize the efficient frontier and the distribution of simulated portfolios.
- **Portfolio Composition**: View the composition of the optimized portfolio in a pie chart.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Choose from predefined ticker sets or input your custom list. Adjust the number of portfolio simulations to control precision and computational time.
